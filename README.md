# Hierarchical core-periphery structure in networks

This code is an implementation of the model for hierarchical core-periphery structure in networks as presented in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03630).

## Installation and usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:dvdbaggio/hcp.git
   cd hcp
     ```
2. Create a build directory and compile the code:
     ```bash
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```
3. Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
4. Open script.ipynb and follow the instructions to run the code, it's straightforward.
